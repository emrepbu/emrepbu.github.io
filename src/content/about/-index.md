I'm a software engineer with experience in web development, cloud technologies, and system architecture. I'm passionate about creating efficient, scalable applications and exploring new technologies.

Currently working on various projects that involve modern web frameworks, containerization technologies, and cloud infrastructure. I enjoy solving complex problems and continuously learning new skills in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
